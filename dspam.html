This project adds Python support, bug fixes, and additional utilities
to the excellent 
<a href="http://www.networkdweebs.com/software/dspam/">DSPAM</a> project
provided by
<a href="mailto:j%6F%6E%61%74h%61%6E%40%6E%65%74work%64w%65%65%62%73%2E%63%6F%6D">Jonathan A. Zdziarski</a>.  
Neither BMS or Stuart Gathman are affiliated with Jonathan Zdziarski 
or <a href="http://networkdweebs.com/">Network Dweebs</a>, except as
enthusiastic users of their free product.
<p>
What is DSPAM?  Here is an excerpt from
the DSPAM project README:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.networkdweebs.com/software/dspam/">DSPAM</a> is an
open-source, freely available anti-spam solution designed to combat
unsolicited commercial email using Baye's theorem of combined probabilities.
The result is an administratively maintenance free system capable of learning 
each user's email behaviors with very few false positives.
<p>
DSPAM can be implemented in one of two ways:
<ol>
<li> The DSPAM mailer-agent provides server-side spam filtering, quarantine
box, and a mechanism for forwarding spams into the system to be automatically
analyzed.
<li>Developers may link their projects to the dspam core engine (libdspam) in
accordance with the GPL license agreement.  This enables developers to
incorporate libdspam as a "drop-in" for instant spam filtering within their
applications - such as mail clients, other anti-spam tools, and so on.
</ol>
Many of the ideas incorporated into this agent were contributed by Paul
Graham's excellent 
<a href="http://paulgraham.com/spam.html">
white paper on combatting SPAM</a>.
Many new approaches have also been implemented by DSPAM.

The RPMs for dspam-2.6.2 available from this web page include a <a
href="//www.python.org">Python</a> module which wraps the dspam core engine
(libdspam).  All of the dspam command line tools are reimplemented in 
Python to illustrate use of the library.  (The Python versions are not
installed by the RPM.)  The RPMs also include patches to add a new
libdspam entry point: _ds_tokenize(), and a new tool, dspam_anal.py, is
implemented in Python to illustrate its use.
<p>
The RPMs also include patches for many bug fixes to the original dspam code,
and both C and Python unit tests to make sure they stay fixed.  Python includes
a built-in unit testing framework.  The C tests use the 
<a href="http://check.sourceforge.net">check project</a>.  The RPM build
procedure does not attempt to build or run the unit tests, so the check
framework is not needed to build the RPM.
<p>
For a really powerful mail filtering system, combine the DSPAM Python
module with <a href="http://www.sendmail.org">sendmail</a> and
<a href="milter.html">Python Milter</a>.

<h2> Downloads </h2>

Pick one of the following.  The binary RPM is the easiest, and will run
on Red Hat 7.2 or 7.3 (and probably later versions).  The source RPM
can be recompiled to match your distribution.  And finally, you can
grab the original sources and my patches and do it yourself.
<p>
Release 3 splits python support into a sub package, adds unit test and
fix for CORPUS bug.
