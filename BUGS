"Unchecked not spam" treats any new messages coming in since the
page was refreshed as unchecked.  Since checkbox fields only report
checked fields, there doesn't seem to be any way to fix this without
changing the form.  Could provide some javascript with "select all"
button, then use checked for both spam and not spam.
