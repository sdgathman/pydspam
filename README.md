# Python interface to libdspam

This is a python extension module to enable python scripts to
use libdspam functionality.  A higher level wrapper handles a
signature database and quarantine mbox in a user directory.

This release updates pydspam for Python3. Because the Python C-API changed
since python-2.7, this is considered a Beta release. I do have it
running on several production systems with no problems.
